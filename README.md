   <a href="https://github.com/Nayan-000-Kalita/Advanced-Programming-Lab/tree/BFS-DFS-Undirected-Graph">Q4.BFS and DFS in an undirected graph
<br>
</a>
   Write a Program to implement <br>(i) BFS and <br>(ii) DFS in an undirected graph to identify the set of connected components in the graph.
Consider the graphs to be stored in the form of an adjacency list in a text file. Read the file and convert to an adjacency matrix representation if necessary.
A sample test file asn3a.txt is attached.

   <a href="https://github.com/Nayan-000-Kalita/Advanced-Programming-Lab/tree/Simple-linked-list">Q7. Simple linked list to Insert,Delete,Search,Display
<br>
</a>
  Write a program that can perform the following operations on a simple linked list of integers - insert (any position), delete (any position), append (last position), search, and display.

Bonus: Modify the program to allow creation of a linked list of structures/class objects. Each node in the linked list can hold data of a single student with - roll number and marks of 4 subjects.

<br>
</a>
 Write a program to sort an array of N integers (given as input via a text file) using -<br>
a. Merge Sort<br>
b. Quick Sort
  </p> 
  
  <p>
   <a href="https://github.com/Nayan-000-Kalita/Advanced-Programming-Lab/tree/Quick-Binary">Q10. Quick Sort-Binary Search

<br>
</a>
  Write a program that sorts a list of names and roll numbers on a file in alphabetical order using Quicksort and write the names and corresponding roll numbers onto a new file.
 Use Binary Search to allow the user to search for a name and display the corresponding roll number. 
 Implement both Iterative and Recursive variations of the Binary Search algorithm.

   <a href="https://github.com/Nayan-000-Kalita/Advanced-Programming-Lab/tree/Square-Matrix">Q11. Square Matrix
<br>
</a>
  Write a program to take as input a square matrix, A, and compute the following:<br>
i) |A|<br>
ii) c*A , where c is a scalar value given as user input<br>
iii) The transpose of A <br>
iv) The square of A i.e. A*A <br>
v) The inverse of A <br>
Note that A can be of any dimension n x n and will be given as input via a text file. You can consider the attached file as a sample input.
